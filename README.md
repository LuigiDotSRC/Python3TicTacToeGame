## Description: 

Using Python, I implemented the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe through logic checks. The player's move is stored in a dictionary which will be checked to see if it matches a winning scenario. After learning Tkinter, I returned to this project to implement a GUI interface to make it easier for the user to play, rather then having to input commands on the terminal.
