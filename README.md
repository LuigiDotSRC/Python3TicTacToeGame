# Python3TicTacToeGame
Using Python, I recreated the Tic-Tac-Toe game which can be played directly in the terminal by executing the code
2 players can play by typing the same terminal, a player wins when they control 3 consecutive spaces either 
vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The code itself uses brute-force to check whether the spaces the player 
control is a win condition at the end of each player's turn to check if they have won.
